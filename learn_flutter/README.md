# Overview

This project was a simple demonstration project of an app I want to build. It will be called 208 trader and the hope of this app is it will be the KSL classifieds of Idaho. I created a login register page a home page that displays all the items that are being listed then a profile page that you can update your profile such as your e-mail  first name and last name. You can also refresh the web page after you created a new listing to see more listings.

How to use the app first you will need to click the register button sign up and then it will kick you out to the home page. This page is displaying all the things for sale currently in the Idaho trader app. You can click the lower left button that is a + to add an item to the marketplace. If you need to update your user profile after you submitted your item in the marketplace you can actually go to the top right corner click on the little person image and then it will open up and you can see all your personal details and click edit at the bottom to update any personal details that you need to.

As a developer I was hoping to learn a lot during this project especially when it comes to front end back end development how to use http requests as well as understanding the language flutter and dart.
